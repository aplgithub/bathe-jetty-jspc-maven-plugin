= Bathe JSPC Compiler for Jetty

This assumes the use of web fragments and properly constructs them for JSPs. The standard jsp compiler for Jetty
does not support web fragments, this one *only* supports web fragments.

It is a bit icky because it dictates the version of Jetty and requires re-release for a new version. Generally that
isn't too much of a problem as  the jsp layer doesn't change between verions of Jetty.
